# üëÅÔ∏è Retinal Disease Detector

A deep learning Streamlit web app to detect retinal diseases from OCT images, with AI-generated explanations and treatment suggestions.

‚úÖ Model performance:

* Final test accuracy: \~91.6%
* Trained on \~2800 images across 8 classes
* Custom CNN (5 conv layers + dense layers with batch normalization & dropout)

## Features

* Upload retinal OCT image (jpg, jpeg, png)
* Predicts among 8 retinal conditions:

  * AMD (Age-related Macular Degeneration)
  * CNV (Choroidal Neovascularization)
  * CSR (Central Serous Retinopathy)
  * DME (Diabetic Macular Edema)
  * DR (Diabetic Retinopathy)
  * DRUSEN (Yellow deposits under retina)
  * MH (Macular Hole)
  * NORMAL (Healthy eyes)
* Gets explanation & treatment suggestions from Groq API
